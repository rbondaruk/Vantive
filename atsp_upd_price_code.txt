For cross-referenced parts we should create another proc to call that will return the value we need.  call it atsp_crss_rf_pkg.atso_crss_rf

the atsp_crss_rf_pkg.atso_crss_rf should do the following:

parms for the proc are:
pass in the ITEMID to the proc
pass in the TYPE you want to look for (either 'Update' or 'New/Exchange' from below)
pass in the ACTIVE you are looking for (either 1 or 0)

select count(icr.switemmasterid)
from sw_item_cross_ref icr
where icr.switemmasterid = ITEMID
and icr.swaliastype = TYPE
and icr.swactive = ACTIVE

return the count.
end proc


to get inventory count use the following;

select sum(c.SWAVAILABLEQTY)
FROM   SW_STOCK_COUNTS c, SW_STOCK_STATUS s
WHERE  	s.swItemMasterId = itemid
and	s.SWFAMILY	 = 'Good'
and	c.swStockStatusid = s.SWSTOCKSTATUSID;


Proc Pseudo-Code for update_price_code

NOTE: In this proc you can call the proc ATSP_DRV_ECADATE_PKG.ATSP_DRV_ECADATE to get the ECA_DATE for any item master record.

If ATSUPPORTSTRATEGY = 'Local Repair' then 
	Price Code = L

else if ATPARTSTATUS in ('Inactive','Obsolete') and there is an active cross reference with Type = Update then 
	Price Code = 4, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS in ('Inactive','Obsolete') and ECA Date => SYSDATE then 
	Price Code = 1,

else if ATPARTSTATUS in ('Inactive','Obsolete') and ECA Date < SYSDATE then 
	Price Code = 7, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' and ECA Date < today and inventory count > 0 then 
	Price Code = J, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' and (ATDCINVENTORYDISPOSITION = 'Use Till Gone' or ATFIELDINVENTORYDISPOSITION = 'Use Till Gone') and there is an non-active cross-reference with Type = Update then 
	price code = X, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' and ATSUPPORTSTRATEGY = 'Inter-Company' then 
	Price Code = V, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' and ATPARTTYPE in ('Expensed Kit', 'Virtual Kit', 'Build to Order', 'Build to Stock') then 
	Price Code = B, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' and ATLIFETIMEBUY = 1 then 
	Price Code = 9, 

else if ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active and Local Part Class = New and there is an active cross reference with a Type = 'New/Exchange' and it is cross referenced to another part with ATPARTSTATUS = 'Active' then 
	Price Code = R.
